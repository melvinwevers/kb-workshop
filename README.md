# Mining Delpher Data
## Harvest, Clean and Analyse Large Amounts of Digitised Text
When analysing sources of the National Library of the Netherlands (KB), researchers often use Delpher, the online gateway to more than 10 million pages of historical text (newspapers, books,journals & radio bulletins), mostly in Dutch. Delpher allows you to search and browse all documents in full text, making it a good resource for close reading. However, when you want to analyse large amounts of data to do distant reading, the KB allows researchers access to both the digital images, metadata, and full text in bulk via KB’s Dataservices & API’s, as well as additional data such as the Medieval Illuminated Manuscripts and the Dutch Digital Parliamentary Papers.
